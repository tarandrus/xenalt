# xenalt
Useful tool to manage multiple Xenimus accounts.
Feel free to browse the source and compile yourself. If you trust me (don't trust anybody on Xenimus), you can download the pre-compiles .exe file.

The concept here is that you only ever need to update your main Xenimus install, and all other "alt" accounts have symbolic links to all data with the exception of the "paif.dat" file which holds your account number information.

In Windows 10+ (maybe lower too), the exe must run as an Administrator (Right click and select "Run as administrator").
